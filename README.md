# Why are the sprinklers running? It's raining! THAT'S WASTED WATER

Ah, you're new here. Welcome to Belterra. The sprinklers are hooked up to the WCID grey water system. All that rain water you see in the retention ponds needs to be redistributed back out. No water is actually being wasted. This is a water management issue designed to help minimize flooding in the community.

# I love the ducks! 

We do too! Mostly. They might be tasty. We'll never tell.

# ... but someone keeps stealing the duck eggs

This explanation has been graciously stolen from a neighbor.

1. This “issue” is not new, this has been going on for years.
2. Hays Co Sheriff has been contacted and reports that the taking of the eggs isn’t illegal.
3. Our local Constable has been contacted and reports that the taking of the eggs isn’t illegal.
4. The Game Warden has been contacted and reports that the taking of the eggs isn’t illegal.
5. The people that are taking the eggs have been confronted and been treated horribly, up to and including verbal assault, which can be illegal depending on the severity.
6. The ducks in that pond aren’t wild ducks that chose to live here. They are ducks that have been dumped in the pond by various groups and even former owners that don’t want the ducks anymore, in many if not all cases without the permission of the WCID.
7. The ducks don’t seem to care or notice if their eggs go missing, they just lay more.
8. There really isn’t much difference in picking up duck eggs and buying duck or chicken eggs. In the end, some fowl laid the egg, and someone picked it up to sell it to you.
So by all means, continue with the waving of the arms, the pulling of hair and gnashing of teeth, but do keep in mind that no amount of ranting here will accomplish anything.
